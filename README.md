# Xil
Xil is a high level concatenative programming language based on [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)) by Manfred  von Thun of La Trobe 
University in Melbourne, Australia.

This started out as a port from the prototype C source but has since drifted 
somewhat. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an idiomatic reference
implementation for .NET that is faithful to the [original specification](https://github.com/basp/xil/blob/vnext/doc/joy.txt).
